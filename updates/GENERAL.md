## Multi Language Support 🔠

> Chrome started shipping a [Translator API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/translator-api) in their browsers. This downloads a light-weight local language translation model on your device.


I have an update ready that integrates with this browser api and offers an `Auto Translation` feature for the extensions. I've integrated and tested it on `No Spoilers` extension and am planning a release once it's thoroughly tested.


The release is probably going to be for `Youtube Miniplayer` extension first since it has a smaller user base and I will be eventually rolling it out for `No Spoilers` later down the line.
